Please feel free to look at the source code. We tried to make the code as understandable as possible.

While developing this package we sticked to the following rules:

* We always used `height` and `aspect-ratio` instead of using `weight`.
* We used `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` as a placeholder for color.
* The styling is intended to be overwritten.
* Cards have a minimum z-Index of 1
